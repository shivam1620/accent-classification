# accent-classification

This project presents a machine learning pipeline that distinguishes Argentinian accents from others in audio samples. It features a comparative analysis of logistic regression and random forest classifiers, leveraging the Librosa library for audio feature extraction. With random forest achieving 82% accuracy, future work will focus on feature selection, data augmentation, and potentially implementing convolutional neural networks for improved classification. This work sets the groundwork for more sophisticated accent recognition technologies.
